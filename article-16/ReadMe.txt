This source code is the demo code accompanying the delphiDabbler article
"How to use the TListView OnCustomDrawXXX events" available from
https://delphidabbler.com/articles/article-16.

Compile the source code using Delphi (Created with Delphi 4 and tested
with Delphi 4 and Delphi 7).

Run the program.

Each of the examples from the article is displayed on a different tab
of the display. Examine the source code of the various tabs do see how
the OnCustomDrawXXX event handlers have been used to customise the
appearance of the list view.

Demo 1: Background Bitmap shows how to tile a bitmap in the background
of the list view. Check the check box to display the text transparently
over the background and clear it to show the text with a window colour
background.

Demo 2: Alternating Rows shows how to alternately colour the list view
rows.

Demo 3: Rainbow Columns shows how to display each list view column in a
different colour.

Demo 4: Custom Fonts shows how to display different fonts or font
attributes in a column.

Demo 5: Shaded Column shows how to highlight a selected column with a
shading colour like Explorer does for the current sort column under
Windows XP. Click a column header to highlight its column.
