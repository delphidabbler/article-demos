# Demo code for Article 19

This directory contains demo code for DelphiDabbler's article "[How to make a TWebBrowser become the active control when clicked](https://delphidabbler.com/articles/article-19)".

The demo was not originally developed under version control. The date of its last update before being placed under version control is not known. The code was added to the [`delphidabbler/article-demos`](https://github.com/delphidabbler/article-demos) GitHub repository on 14 June 2022.

## About the Demo

The code was originally targetted at Delphi 7 and has not been tested with other versions of the compiler.

There are three projects, in sub-folders `1`, `2` & `3`, that have the following purposes:

1. Illustrates the problem. It is the code presented in Listings 1 and 2 in the article.
2. Illustrates the first solution. It is the code from listings 4 and 5.
3. Illustrates the second solution. It is the code from listings 6 and 7.

Load and compile each of the demo projects from their respective folders. Click in each of the three controls and see the name of the focussed control change in the status bar. Observe the different in behaviour in each of the solutions (demos 2 & 3) compared with the default behaviour of demo 1.
