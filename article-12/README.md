# Demo code for Article 12

This directory contains demo code for DelphiDabbler's article "[How to add a program to the Explorer Send To menu](https://delphidabbler.com/articles/article-12)".

The demo was not originally developed under version control. It's last update was probably in 2004. The code was added to the [`delphidabbler/article-demos`](https://github.com/delphidabbler/article-demos) GitHub repository on 14 June 2022.

To learn how to use the demo see `ReadMe.txt`.

## About the Demo

The demo project comprises a single Delphi project: `SendToDemo.dpr`. Compile the project and run the resulting application. Then:

1. Click the "Create Send-To Shortcut" shortcut button to create a short cut to the program in the current user's Send To folder.

2. Exit the application.

3. Select one or more files in Explorer then select the Send To "mouse menu". Select the new "Send To Demo" option. The demo program will start and the names of the selected file(s) will be displayed in the program.

When finished experimenting click the "Delete Send-To Shortcut" button to tidy up.
