	Sample HTML
</h1>
<p>
	This sample page is stored with <strong>UTF-8 encoding</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Its purpose is to be loaded into the demo program's HTML Code window and
	either edited or loaded using the <em>Load from String</em> or <em>Load from
	Stream</em> buttons.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>WARNING:</strong> Using the <em>Save to String</em> and <em>Save to
	Stream</em> with this code loaded into the browser control may cause
	unexpected results in demos compiled without Unicode support. Non-Unicode
	versions of <em>UWebBrowserWrapper</em> do not fully support non-ANSI
	encodings.
